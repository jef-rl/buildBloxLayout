# Legacy registry usage ledger

This ledger tracks remaining references to legacy registry shims, dispatcher utilities, and UI state bridge types.

## Status

- ✅ No references to the retired framework source tree remain.
- ✅ NXT registries, selectors, and view hosts are the only supported runtime APIs.

## Follow-up

If new legacy references are introduced, update this ledger and add the migration steps needed to return to NXT-only usage.
